// Create 3 divs that each look like a picture frame. Each one should have a unique background image and a button underneath that swaps the image from the frame. Use the traversing functions of jQuery to accomplish this.
//
//     The left frame swaps to the right and takes the image from the frame in the center.
//     The center frame swaps randomly to either the left or right.
//     The right frame swaps to the left and takes the image from the frame in the center.
