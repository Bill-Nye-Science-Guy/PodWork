    // A couple challenges I have for those finished with the loops exercise but wanting more practice:
    // Write a function that uses a loop to console.log "99 bottles of beer on the wall" until the passed argument number. Use a break to exit the loop, and console.log the message "Aw no, we're not doing that song again," in the event the argument is a number greater than or equal to 99, less than 0, or is not a number.

    /*
    loop that console logs " 99 bottles of beer on the wall"
    the argument for this function will dictate when to stop console logging
    we will stop this by exiting the loop using break >>
    console log " NO! were not doing that song again if the argument passed is >= to 99 && 0< or not a number.
     */
    function bottlesSong(bottles) {
        if(isNaN(bottles) || bottles < 0 || bottles > 99){
            console.log("NO! were not doing that song again!");
        }else{
            for (var i = 1; i < 100; i++){
                if (i === bottles){
                    console.log("EndOfSong");
                    break;
                }else{
                    console.log( i + " BOTTLES OF BEER ON THE WALL!")}
            }
        }
    }

    console.log(bottlesSong(70));
    // Write a loop that will console.log hexadecimal numbers until it reaches '100' (uninclusive). Take a look at this stackoverflow post for information on converting decimal numbers to hexadecimal.  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57803/how-to-convert-decimal-to-hexadecimal-in-javascript
    // Write a loop that prompts the user to confirm if they have drank water today. This loop should run until the user has confirmed the prompt (clicked yes) 6 times.







    // Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number.
    //
    //     For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.
    //
    // Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer
    // dont want it to be a string
    // should return integer

    function squaredDigit(number) {
    return Number(number)
    return parseFloat(number)
    }
